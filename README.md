# Learning and Practice of Python Fundamentals
I'm currently using this repository to store and showcase my own demonstrations of various Python topics.
The aim is to practice and solidify understanding in areas that I feel I'm weaker at or functionality that I don't get the opportunity to use very often. 
It will also be a good reference point for me to come back to if I ever wanted/need to implement some of these features and need a refresher.
